        The fishing adventure continues with the Book of Dead slot. It offers a high RTP and a decent Max Win with several exciting modifiers in the free spins. <br /> <br />

This slot has 5 reels, 3 rows, and 10 paylines. The base game doesn’t have much going on, and you will have to wait for the Free Spins bonus round. The Fish Money symbols can be won during the Free Spins, and there are up to 5 modifiers that can apply randomly in any round. <br /> <br />

This slot has Wild symbols, Multipliers, Nudges, Respins, and more. You can easily buy the Free Spins, which wasn’t possible in the original slot. We will explain everything in detail soon, so keep reading this review.<br /> <br />

                <strong>Theme and Design</strong>
The theme is similar to other Big Bass free online slots, which is not surprising. We expected the theme to revolve around fishing, but the theme of this slot has its own style and approach that makes it different. The background is a very detailed underwater view of the lake. In the background, you can see fish swimming, colourful underwater plants, jellyfish, bubbles, sand, and much more. <br /> <br />

The soundtrack is light and upbeat, like similar slots. A sound similar to a drop of water hitting the water is made when you spin the reels. We appreciate the effort that they have put into creating this elegant theme. <br /> <br />

<strong>Symbols</strong>
The monster truck, fishing rod, dragonfly, bait box, and Fish Money symbols are high-paying symbols. The high-paying symbols will pay you 20x to 200x of your bet for landing winning combinations with five matching symbols. The low-paying symbols are the card symbols, and they only pay 5x to 10x of your bet for landing a five-of-a-kind winning combination. <br /> <br />

The Wild symbol is the cheerful bearded fisherman, who has been featured in several other slots. The Scatter symbol is a hooked bass fish trying to escape by jumping out of the water. <br /> <br />

                The Free Spins feature with 5 modifiers is the main bonus you will look forward to. It is not very hard to trigger the Free Spins round, as you will get the chance to get a 3rd Scatter if you manage to land 2. Let us start exploring the features in detail. <br /> <br />

Free Spins Feature
You can trigger Free Spins by landing 3 or more Scatter symbols on the reels. Following are the number of Free Spins you will get after landing Scatters. <br /> <br />

3 Scatters = 10 Free Spins <br />
4 Scatters = 15 Free Spins <br />
5 Scatters = 20 Free Spins <br />
If you only land 2 Scatters on the reels, you may get a chance to land the 3rd one. If the Scatters on the reels can move down one position while staying inside the play area, a Respin will be awarded. In the Respins, the reels with Scatters will move down by one position, and the rest of the reels will Respin for a chance to land another Scatter. <br /> <br />

Before Free Spins start, 0 to 5 modifiers that will apply to the subsequent round will be chosen randomly. Here are the modifiers. <br /> <br />

More Fish: More Fish Money symbols will be there on the reels for the subsequent Free Spins round. <br /> <br />
More Fisherman: More Wild symbols will be there during the subsequent Free Spins round. <br /> <br />
More Dynamites, Hooks, and Bazookas: Your chance of triggering the Dynamite, Hook, or Bazooka Spin feature is increased.
Start From Level 2: The Free Spins will start from level 2 in the Progressive feature. <br /> <br />
2 Extra Spins: The subsequent round will have 2 extra Free Spins from the start, and you will get 2 more spins on every retrigger. <br /> <br />
The Fisherman Wild symbol only appears during the Free Spins, and it will collect and award the values of the Money symbols. All Wilds are collected, and collecting every 4th Wild will ensure that you retrigger the Free Spins. You will get 10 more Free Spins, and the Multiplier for Money symbols will increase to 2x, 3x, and 10x for the second, third, and fourth levels, respectively. <br /> <br />
You will get the retriggered spins as soon as the current batch of Free Spins ends. However, you can’t retrigger Free Spins after reaching the fourth level on the Progressive Meter. <br /> <br />

Three random features can be triggered at the end of a Free Spin. Following are the random features. <br /> <br />

Dynamite Spin Feature: Fish symbols can appear in random positions through the Dynamite Spin feature when there are only Wilds on the reels but no Money symbol. <br /> <br />
Hook Spin Feature: A hook can pull up a random reel to reveal a Fisherman symbol when you have Money symbols but no Fisherman symbols on the reels. <br /> <br />
Bazooka Spin Feature: When you have Fisherman symbols but no Fish symbols, the Bazooka feature can change all symbols into other symbols except for the Fisherman symbols. <br /> <br />
Note that you can also buy Free Spins through the Buy Free Spins option by paying 100x of your stake. <br /> <br />
