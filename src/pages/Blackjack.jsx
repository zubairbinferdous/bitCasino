    <div className="section-container custom-bg">
        <p>
        The name of this classic card-game is inspired by the Italian word "baccara", and the very meaning of the word is zero (0), which is also the value of all picture cards and 10s in a deck of cards. These basic rules and very important to udnersntand when you want to learn how to play Baccarat. <br /> <br />

In this card game, it is customary to play with 6 or 8 decks of cards. These are all placed in a shoe/shoes. <br /> <br />

A Baccarat hand consists of two playing cards. Further cards can be dealt but only according to specific rules. The croupier in this game is also known as bank or banker. The game begins when the croupier has cards dealt for minimum two hands:

The banker's hand. <br /> <br />
Player hand (first two cards)
Although it may sound confusing to mention now, you are not only limited to betting money on the player (your cards), and you do not always win player's hand wins. <br /> <br />

After the cards are dealt by the croupier at the table, it is now time to determine the points and the value of each hand based on the following casino rules for online and live Baccarat. Same card value rules are used for all players at the table. <br /> <br />
        </p>

        <h3 className="section-title">Value of hands for both the player and bank hand</h3>
         <div className="section-container custom-bg">
        <p>
        As mentioned before, all 10s and picture cards count as zero points. The other cards retain their face value/sum. That is, all card with the numbers 1 to 9 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) retain their card value. <br /> <br />

To not create misunderstandings, let me clarify that the ace is counted as the number 1. <br /> <br />

If the dealer or players have two cards and have a total of 10 or more, we must subtract ten (10) from the total value. Here is an example that is easy to understand. <br /> <br />

Example: If I get 8 of spades and 7 of diamonds, then the sum is not 15 (8 + 7) but five instead as we calculate 8 + 7 = 15 but minus the 10. <br /> <br />

This card example is a simplified explanation. As you will discover, things are a little more complicated; however, not too much. <br /> <br />

If you think online baccarat sounds exciting, then there is a link to playing live baccarat on the internet, and there is a video that shows you how it works. It is a great way to understand the concept behind this beloved card game. <br /> <br />

Click on the live dealer, and you will land on our page that shows you how live baccarat is played on the internet. <br /> <br />

        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            Here, everything gets a little more complicated, so keep reading if you're trying to figure out how to play Baccarat properly. If you do not have to have a third card, then Bank must remain on two card if he or she has 6 or 7 in total. If the dealer's hand has a value of 0 to 5, the casino must have a third card. <br /> <br />

Otherwise, the following rules apply to the game: <br /> <br />

If the player draws 9, 10, Ace or picture cards as the third card, the Bank must draw an extra card if their value is 0-3 and stay with 4-7 in the score. <br /> <br />
If players get an eight as their third card, then the banker must draw a card if they have 0-2 in total and remain standing if the hand total is three to seven (3-7). <br /> <br />
If the player draws a six or seven (6-7) as the third card, then banks must have an extra with a 0-6 score and be left with a value of 7.
If you as a player get a four or five (4 and 5) as your third card, then the casino must draw a card if the Bank has 0-5 in total and must stay at 6 and 7. <br /> <br />
If your third card is a 2 or 3, then the dealer must have an extra if he or she has 0-4 in total and remain standing with the values 5, 6, and 7. <br /> <br />
Once all the Punto Banco cards have been dealt, you only need to count baccarat points to see the winner. The one who comes closest to nine (9) points is the winner. If you make your bets in online Baccarat, then it is all a little easier and more manageable as it all happens automatically. <br /> <br />

There are three types of bets/bets you can make in all places where you can bet money on Baccarat. <br /> <br />

<br /> <br />

        <h3 className="section-title">The Basic type of bets in Baccarat - Player, Bank and Tie bet</h3>
        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            Player: You bet on yourself or other players. Payout is 1 to 1. <br /> <br />
Bank/Banker: You bet that the dealer wins. Pays 1 to 1 (-5% commission). <br /> <br />
Tie/Draw: Bank and player have the same sum. Usually, the payout is at least 8 to 1. <br /> <br />
Sometimes there is NOT a winner in Baccarat, and it is called tie bets or draw if you play in online casinos. <br /> <br />

If the player and croupier have the same baccarat total, then the baccarat result is final, and only winnings will be paid out to the gamblers who have bet their money on the TIE bet. <br /> <br />

However, you get your bet back, so you do not lose anything if, for example, you have bet 100 on the bank or player, and the result is a TIE. <br /> <br />

These three bets are the basic bets that you can make in all versions of Baccarat. From time to time, it happens that the casinos offer you side bets. For example, the casino could offer you bets where you bet that the following result in the baccarat game will be a pair of 2s or similar. <br /> <br />

        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            Always be cautious about your money when gambling online, and keep in the following couple of things every time you decide to gamble: <br /> <br />

Set a betting budget for yourself before gambling online, carefully set this budget according to your financial position, and stick to it. Do not ever cross the gambling budget. Always gamble responsibly.
The time you put in gambling is also important, always set a timer before your gambling session, and stop gambling when the time runs out, even if you have money left in your gambling budget.
These are some basic things you should follow before every betting session. Don't go out of hand even if you are gambling for free, as it still adds to your gambling addiction. <br /> <br />

Is it worth claiming a No Deposit Bonus?
The No Deposit Bonus is clearly the most popular bonus an online casino can offer its customers. Everybody likes a freebie, regardless of age, gambling experience, and betting type. The general thought on No Deposit Bonuses is that they are totally harmless and can only result in benefit. This is true to some extent, but one should never blindly take decisions when it comes to money and gambling. These No Deposit Bonuses usually come with a set of terms and conditions, always read them before claiming the bonus benefits. <br /> <br />
