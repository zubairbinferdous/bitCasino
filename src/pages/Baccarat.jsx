    Welcome to BETO's ultimate blackjack guide, in this comprehensive guide you'll learn everything from the card rules to the advanced systems of this casino game. We go in-depth with blackjack strategy and what it takes to win more than you lose in both live and online casinos when you play Blackjack. <br /> <br />

My name is Kim Birch, and I have the honour of writing this ultimate blackjack guide. I am known for being one of the first Danes to make a living playing Poker. But in fact, I have been playing Blackjack for as long as Poker. <br /> <br />

I learned both casino games at an early age. When I play, whether it's card games like Blackjack or original roulette at the local casino, then I use game knowledge to guide me. I have always spent a lot of time and research gaining an advanced understanding of game theory. I never bet on a game without having an advanced understanding of the math behind the casino games.

It is not just a matter of knowing the rules of a card game like Blackjack if your goal is to win more than you lose in the battle against the casino.
If you only know the blackjack rules, you can lose your money faster than you can count to three.  <br /> <br />

When I found out that I could make a living playing poker, it allowed me to study other casino games like Blackjack.  This way, I learned the tips, tricks and strategies needed to get an edge. Now you can learn how to play blackjack as a pro for free and learn how to beat the dealer in different situations at the table. <br /> <br />

                      <p>
                      In most Blackjack variants, you play against the house (casino), and therefore it is required that you know what to do in any blackjack situation and that you become a basic strategy player. Therefore, you need to adhere to these principles and casino rules without asking too many questions.  <br /> 
        <br />

It also does not matter that you take a chance because you think you know better. For example, I have personally tried to lose over 50 grand at  blackjack tables in Las Vegas on one hand because I thought it was too risky to take a third card. Yet, I knew deep down that it would have been mathematically correct to take an extra card in the situation. <br /><br />

In short, I got cold feet and did not dare say HIT to the blackjack croupier to get an extra card. After this experience, I chose to study Blackjack as thoroughly as I had studied poker. <br /><br />

Through various blackjack books and personal training of some of the world's best blackjack players, such as Ken Einiger, world champion in Blackjack in 2005, I managed to reach a professional level in Blackjack. <br /><br />

This blackjack guide aims to get gamblers worldwide knowledge up to an advanced and professional blackjack level. Unfortunately, the material you can find online is very deficient. Whether you like to learn about double deck games, how to play against the dealer's hole card or learn a card counting system that works at your blackjack tables, this guide can help you and guide you i in the right direction. <br /><br />

        Online poker is still trendy worldwide, but if you go to the local casino on a Saturday night, then all the casino's blackjack tables are "on fire". If you are lucky, there will be just one or two poker tables going on. <br /> rb


The most fascinating thing about blackjack for a player like myself is that at least half of all the people who play blackjack are half drunk and play mathematically incorrect. Therefore, they lose money they did not have to "donate" to the casino. <br /> rb


But this in-depth blackjack guide, I want to give everyone a chance to master the card game of blackjack and make new players aware of the mistakes that too many new blackjack players make. <br /> rb


This guide contains blackjack strategies  and card counting systems that you can use when you gamble, increasing your chances of winning. In addition, this card game guide will better your odds and give you a much better chance of winning more and playing optimal strategy in all situations against the dealer's cards. <br /> rb


As a blackjack gambler, it is imperative that you believe in yourself and that you adhere to the principles you learn here through the blackjack guide and trust the math. Because, unlike nolimit poker, math is by far the most essential element in becoming a consistent winner in this card game.<br /> <br />

      Blackjack, 21, The King of card games. This casino card game has many names. Blackjack is one of the world's most-played card games and one of the most popular casino games in the world.  <br /> <br />

However, even the slightest chance against the casino dealers requires that you learn basic blackjack strategy and the slightly more advanced gambling principles if you want to be a consistent winner. <br /> <br />

It also requires that you do not deviate from what you learn in this blackjack guide and trust the math we present studied by professors and mathematical geniuses. <br /> <br />

Like the rest of the games you find in a casino, blackjack is a business for the casino and designed for players to lose more money than they win in the long run.  <br /> <br />

Suppose we disregard poker, where you play against other players and not against the casino. In that case, blackjack is the only casino game where you can get a mathematical advantage. In this scenario, we look away from casino promotions and blackjack bonuses. <br /> <br />

However, as a blackjack player, you must understand the short game statistics and learn the art of counting cards - also called "card counting". <br /> <br />

The better you learn blackjack and the advanced strategies and systems, the less the casino's mathematical advantage over you will be. <br /> <br />

This means less money lost and more money won in your blackjack games. However, blackjack is not only a game for the lucky ones. Still, it is a card game that requires skill, concentration and good observation skills at the blackjack table. <br /> <br />

If you click on the following picture with European Blackjack, then you can try a free demo version of the blackjack game here at BETO and test the blackjack knowledge that you have learned: <br /> <br />

        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            The Blackjack rules are straightforward to understand at first glance. This is also one reason why blackjack is one of the most in demand casino games in the world. <br /> <br />

At first glance, both online and live blackjack is a straightforward card game to learn. The idea is that you can get a maximum of 21 points in a blackjack hand, and if you get more, you automatically lose to the dealer.  <br /> <br />

Both the dealer and player get two cards to start with, and it is then a matter of getting more blackjack points than the dealer without getting over 21.  <br /> <br />

If the casino goes over 21 points and busts, then all the players at the blackjack table automatically win. You have several options to either draw an extra card or bet on the hand you have already achieved with your first two cards in each round. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

<br /> <br />

        <h3 className="section-title">The first two card in Blackjack</h3>
        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            Before the 21 game starts, the playing cards are shuffled, primarily done in a machine. Then all the cards are placed in a shoe, and one of the players at the table gets a plastic card and is allowed to split the cards so everyone can see there is no cheating. <br /> <br />

Once cards have been shuffled in blackjack and a player has split, the dealer removes the first card. It is called a burn card because it is removed to ensure that the playing cards have not been cheated or tampered with. <br /> <br />

Now your blackjack game starts, and all players are welcomed to place their bets. This must be done before cards are dealt with the players, so you bet blindly. Sometimes it is allowed to sit a few hands over or more if you have asked the dealer. Still, for the most part, a spot is given to a new player if you can not play over a period longer than 5 minutes. <br /> <br />

Once all bets have been placed in blackjack, the casino deals the cards and starts from left to the right. All gamblers get their first two cards and in almost all casinos, the cards are dealt "face-up" so everyone can see what one has been given.  <br /> <br />

The idea that everyone can see each other's two cards will also be harder to cheat at the casino table. It is usual for a casino player not to fiddle with the cards. <br /> <br />

The dealer's first card consists of two cards, just like any other card player at the table. However, only one card from the dealer is face-up, so you can only see the value of one card. <br /> <br />

In very few casinos, all the cards in blackjack are dealt "face down", just like in poker. Here it is allowed to touch the cards, and the others can not see what one has. This is a blackjack rule you see very rarely and primarily only in some of the older American casinos.<br /> <br />

        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            Once you have started betting your blackjack chips and received your first two cards, you come to the next round, where you have a lot of options:

HIT - The first option is to draw a third card, and this is called HIT and comes from the term "hit me" and means that you want one more card. You can draw several cards until you are satisfied with your blackjack hand, or you go bust, which happens when your sum is over 21 in total. <br /> <br />
STAND - If you are happy with your cards and think you can defeat the "house" with your hand, then you can choose to say no thanks to drawing cards and keeping the blackjack hand you already have. <br /> <br />
SPLIT - If you have a pair, you can choose to split them into two different blackjack hands as a player. You must then match your first bet on the new hand. An example could be that you have a pair of fives in your first two cards and choose to split. You now play two hands which are both 5s, and you bet the same amount on both, and you are then dealt an extra card for each of them. In some casinos, you can split several hands, but you are only allowed to split your pairs for the most part. <br /> <br />
DOUBLE DOWN - In most cases, it is allowed to double your bet in blackjack if your first two blackjack cards add up to 9, 10 or 11. It is allowed to "double down" on any two first cards you've received in a few casinos. When you choose to double down, you are allowed to drawcard, and the three cards you then have are your final blackjack hand. <br /> <br />
INSURANCE - When the card the casino has, and as the players can see, is an ace, and all the players at the table have received their two cards, you are asked if you want to buy insurance. Suppose you say yes, to blackjack insurance. In that case, you have to pay half of your bet. If the dealer does not get blackjack by hitting 21 in total, then the hand is played on as usual, but the price you paid for your insurance is lost no matter what. <br /> <br />

            In the first few sections of our ultimate blackjack guide, the rules of blackjack and how to behave in Live Blackjack was described. Now it is time to learn basic blackjack strategy, which is the cornerstone of becoming a winner in blackjack. <br /> <br />

The blackjack strategy is the optimal casino system in which you can play blackjack without counting cards. It is entirely legal, and no blackjack rules are violated.  <br /> <br />

Suppose you learn to master basic blackjack strategy. You will have a greater chance of leaving the casino as a winner than a regular blackjack player as you play mathematically correctly. In that case, you are well on your way to becoming a so-called advantage card player. <br /> <br />

Blackjack basic strategy has been developed by some of the world's best mathematical geniuses. It has been tested for many years and has thus passed its blackjack exam. Rely on the primary system and the math behind the decisions basic blackjack strategy teaches you to make during the game.  <br /> <br />

In addition, it is also essential that you learn the basic blackjack systems by heart and follow them without too much time to think. If you learn your blackjack strategy, you immediately know what to do in every blackjack situation you end up in when you gamble and play blackjack in the casino for real money. <br /> <br />
