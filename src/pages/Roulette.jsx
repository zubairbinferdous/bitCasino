                      <p>
                      Ever since French Roulette was invented in the 17th century, it has been a game surrounded by superstition and mystery. However, most experts believe that Roulette was invented by the French mathematics genius blaise pascal. Thanks to the brothers Francois and Louis Blanc, the game was spread and made famous in European casinos throughout the 19th century. <br /> <br />

One of the frequently asked questions from people interested in Roulette is what the purpose of the wheel game is and what your goal as a player is. In short, your goal as a player is to predict where the ball will land on the wheel. If you succeed, you win.  <br /> <br />

Whether you play Roulette online or in one of the many casinos in the real world, you will be presented with a game table where you play with a wheel that contains a series of numbers from 0-36 or 0-00-36. This depends on whether the casino offers you, european roulette or American Roulette.

These numbers change in different colours between red and black on the Roulette Wheel. Wheel features also offer players a large area to place their bets. <br /> <br />

The payout of winning bets varies depending on the specific type of bets you have placed at the game table. You can choose to place high-risk bets on the individual numbers with high rewards or low-risk bets on colours that can either land on red or black but pay out smaller amounts. <br /> <br />

In addition to colour betting, you can also play on other types of bets in Roulette games with different types of payouts. A lot of famous roulette players combines some of these bets as a way to spread the risk. <br /> <br />

Before you start playing live or online roulette, you must understand the basic principles and rules of the game. Your main goal as a player is to make an intelligent prediction. Some Roulette players tend to choose what they call hot numbers. These are the numbers they often see the ball land on. You need to understand that winning at Roulette is a matter of chance. <br /><br />

        If you are a new player or have never bet money in Roulette casinos, you will now get a crash course in the most critical aspects of playing real casino games online. The information you acquire here through the website can be used online or in Live Casinos, as the rules are the same. <br /> <br />

When you bet money on Roulette, you are playing against the dealer. This is also called playing against the house. The person in charge of the battle is also called a croupier and is employed by the casino. This also applies to online casino. The dealer's responsibility is to swing the wheel around and handle the bets from you and the other players at the table. <br /> <br />

In European and French Roulette, you have 37 numbers in total that the ball can land on. There are the numbers 1 to 36, where they alternate between being black and red numbers. In addition, European/French Roulette variants also have a green field with the number 0. <br /> <br />

American Roulette is slightly different as casinos on the other side of the Atlantic have implemented a double zero (00). Hence, the game has 38 numbers instead of 37. This dirty trick gives the house greater odds against the players. So if you can, then always stick to French and European versions of the game. <br /> <br />

Each player has their own casino chips in their own colour at the table. The dealer can always see who made a bet, so the other players do not get paid your winnings. <br /> <br />

        <p>
        There is a slight difference in how the wheel looks depending on whether you play American Roulette or stick to the European version. But, of course, you, as a casino Roulette player, also have better odds on your side.  <br /> <br />

The big difference is that the American Roulette wheel has 38 numbers on where the ball lands. Two of the total 38 numbered areas are green with the numbers 0 and 00, respectively. <br /> <br />

The picture above of two Roulette wheels shows the slight differences between the 2 variations of European and American Roulette. The following picture shows the French version. As you can probably see, the same wheel is used for both European and French games. <br /> <br />

            As I said, you can find everything about playing live and online Roulette here on our pages, but if you are a beginner, remember these 3 tips:

Start with small amounts when you are at yourfavoritee casino.
Set an amount aside that you can afford to lose. <br /> <br />
Starting with simple bets is a good beginner strategy. <br /> <br />
Some of the more accessible and easy bets you can place are even/odd, and red/black. These ways of betting are easier to make until you have a greater understanding of the game. <br /> <br />

It is a vital Roulette strategy to get a feel for the game before moving into straight-up bets or trying out a Roulette without having learned the odds. As a beginner, it is also impossible to predict where the ball will land. <br /> <br />

Here is a picture of the area where you can place bets in Roulette: <br /> <br />

        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            This section focuses on what kind of betting you can make in the game and what rules and odds apply. <br /> <br />

Your game starts when the croupier throws the ball, and it "dances" around the wheel. As it rotates around, you can make a bet on the numbers or the other options such as a three number bet or a split bet. <br /> <br />

Your option to place a bet ends when the dealer says "NO MORE BETTING". <br /> <br />

The ball then stops on one of the wheel numbers. The numbers will always be red/black or even/odd. However, this does not apply when the numbers 0 and 00 are hit as these areas are green.<br /> <br />

            <p>
            Here it should be mentioned that if you make a bet in your game on odd numbers, then the numbers 0 and 00 do not count in your bet. So the following bets you can make in Roulette are about inside bets.  <br /> <br />

This type of betting are all about placing your casino chips on a single number or using your money on a specific combination of numbers: <br /> <br />

Straight Up: This single number bet is when you choose to make your bet directly on the individual numbers. This also applies to 0 and 00. This type of betting gives payout odds of 35-1. <br /> <br />

Square: Also known as a quarter or corner bet. Here you bet on 4 numbers which form a square. <br /> <br />

Split: A split bet is also known by players as a Cheval. You bet your money on 2 numbers that are next to each other on the table. An example of this is 5 and 6 or 5/8. The payout odds are 17-1. <br /> <br />

Street: The street bet covers three consecutive numbers. There are 12 street bets in total, and examples of this are 1, 2, 3 or 34, 35, and 36. This bet pays 11-1 odds when you win. <br /> <br />

Six lines: This bet in Roulette is also known under the name 'double street' as it is basically 2 streets merged on the table. An example could be a game where you predict the ball will land on one of the following six numbers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The payout on this is 5-1. <br /> <br />

Five-Number: Also called Basket Bet, and is the worst betting option that you can place your chips on as a player. <br /> <br />

Some casinos offer special Roulette rules and bets. For the most part, these will be announced to all the players at the table.. <br /> <br />

        <h3 className="section-title">The Martingale Roulette System</h3>
        <div className="section-container custom-bg">
            <p>
            The casino system above them all when we look at the popularity this strategy has gained over the years. This system is known as the double-up method. It is used not only in Roulette but also by investment people. Martingale is often referenced in gambling articles, movies, and other pop culture. <br /> <br />

The famous Martingale system is easy to learn. One can quickly feel invincible after making a significant monetary gain in a short amount of time. Martingale is super easy for beginners to learn, and the theoretical foundation behind the concept is solid. <br /> <br />

In Martingale, we concentrate only on the bets at the table that pays us 1:1 for winning. Let's say you play with 1 unit of casino chips. This means that you bet 1 unit, and if you win the bet, you get one unit back in profit and your initial wager back. <br /> <br />

Let us say that you bet one unit on black and win. You will now get your one unit in profit, plus the casino will repay your initial bet on black. <br /> <br />

But what happens when you lose using the Martingale system? In such a case, you will bet again, but you will have to double the original bet. So in our case, you select black again bet two (2) units instead. If you see the ball land on black, you get paid 4 units total. Your initial bet of 2 units and the actual 2 units won. <br /> <br />

All in all, your profit will be 1 unit. If you lose, the idea is that you double your bet again and again and again until you win.
